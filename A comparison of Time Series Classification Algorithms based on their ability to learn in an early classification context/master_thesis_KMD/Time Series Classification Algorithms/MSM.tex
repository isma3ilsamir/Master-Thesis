Move-Split-Merge is distance measure that was first introduced in \cite{stefan2012move}.
The main purpose of introducing MSM was to combine certain characteristics within one distance measure.
These are; robustness to misalignments between time series instances, being an actual metric unlike other distance measures like DTW and LCSS,
assure translation invariance and achieve quadratic run-time \cite{lines2015time}.\newline
The way MSM works is pretty much like other edit distance methods; it determines the similarity between two instances
through the usage of a set of operations to transform one of them to the other. These operations, as the name indicates, are; move, split and merge \cite{bagnall2017great}.\newline
Move is the substitution of one single time point of a series with another.
Split divides a single time point of a series into two consecutive time points holding the same value as the originial time point.
Merge can be seen as the opposite of Split, it combines two consecutive time points holding the same value into one time point.\newline
Each of the previously mentioned operations is associated with a cost.
The cost of a move is equal to the absolute difference between the old and the new value of the time point.
The costs of split and merge are equal and they are set to a constant to satisfy the symmetry property of metricity \cite{stefan2012move,tan2020fastee}.
