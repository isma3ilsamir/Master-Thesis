Dynamic Time Warping was a very strong baseline for time series classification for a long time \cite{abanda2019review,bagnall2017great}.
It was first introduced as a technique to recognize spoken words that can deal with misallignments between time series
that Euclidean Distance couldn't handle \cite{tan2020fastee}.\newline
To calculate the distance between two time series instances  $T\textsubscript{1} = [t1\textsubscript{1},t1\textsubscript{2},...t1\textsubscript{n}$]
and $T\textsubscript{2} = [t2\textsubscript{1},t2\textsubscript{2},...t2\textsubscript{n}$];
a distance matrix $M(T\textsubscript{1},T\textsubscript{2})$, of size n $\times$ n, is calculated for $T\textsubscript{1}$ and $T\textsubscript{2}$.
With $M\textsubscript{i,j}(t1\textsubscript{i},t2\textsubscript{j})$ representing the distance between $t1\textsubscript{i}$ $\in$ $T\textsubscript{1}$
and $t2\textsubscript{j}$ $\in$ $T\textsubscript{2}$.
The goal of DTW is to find an optimal path that minimizes the cumulative distance between points of $T\textsubscript{1}$ and $T\textsubscript{2}$.\newline
A candidate path $P = [p\textsubscript{1},p\textsubscript{2},...p\textsubscript{p}]$ is to be found by traversing M.
For a path to be valid it must conform to some conditions:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $p\textsubscript{1} = (t1\textsubscript{1},t2\textsubscript{1})$
    \item $p\textsubscript{p} = (t1\textsubscript{n},t2\textsubscript{n})$
    \item for all i \textless m :
        \begin{itemize}
            \item $0 \leq t1\textsubscript{i+1} - t1\textsubscript{i} \leq 1$
            \item $0 \leq t2\textsubscript{i+1} - t2\textsubscript{i} \leq 1$
        \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

Finding an optimal path under DTW can be computationally expensive with complexity of $O(n^2)$ for a time series of length n \cite{schafer2017fast,petitjean2016faster}.
Consequently it is usual to use a contraint with the path; to prevent comparison of points outside a certain window \cite{tan2020fastee}; like the famous Sakoe-Chiba Band \cite{sakoe1978dynamic}, Itakura Parallelogram \cite{itakura1975minimum} and Ratanamahatana-Keogh Band \cite{ratanamahatana2004making}.
Typically DTW can make use of it's warping window to handle distortion in time series,
but still it is vulnerable to cases where the differene in length between instances length is larger than the warping window \cite{tan2019time}.
