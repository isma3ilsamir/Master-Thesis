General notes about time series classification problem:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Types of Data
	    \begin{enumerate}
	        \item Static Data \newline
	        Data which describe characteristics of the studied instances or properties that won't change with time. These could be the date of birth of a patient, or the species of an animal.
	        \item Dynamic Data \newline
	            \begin{enumerate}
	                \item Several variables from one or more objects observed in a series of time
	                    \begin{enumerate}
	                        \item On one object -> time series data
	                        \item On multiple objects -> Panel data
	                    \end{enumerate}
                    \item Data Balance
                        \begin{enumerate}
                            \item Balanced: Observation carried out thoroughly on all objects in a series of time
                            \item Unbalanced: When several variables of each object can't be full observed in the same timeframe
                        \end{enumerate}
	            \end{enumerate}
	    \end{enumerate}
    \item Types of Models
	    \begin{enumerate}
	        \item Univariate Model \newline
	        We Predict an object with some characteristics will be in which group based on a categorical variable
		    \item Multivariate Model \newline
		    Same as univariate but on multiple categorical variables simultaneously
	    \end{enumerate}
    \item Different Time Series Classification Techniques
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item Similarity-based techniques
            \item Interval-based techniques
            \item Shapelet-based techniques
            \item Dictionary-based techniques
            \item Combination of transformations
        \end{enumerate}
