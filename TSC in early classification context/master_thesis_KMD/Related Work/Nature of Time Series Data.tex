Having discussed the dependency assumptions in time the different forms of time series data.
It is this dependency that makes time series data challenging for conventional machine learning algorithms, which are used for tabular and cross-sectional data.
Tabular and cross-sectional data assume observations to be independent and identically distributed (i.i.d) \cite{loning2019sktime}.\newline
If we were to tabularize time series data; convert it into a tabular form by considering each observation as an individual feature.
Then it would be possible to apply conventional machine learning algorithms, under the implicit modelling assumption that observations are not ordered.
This means that if the order of the features was changed, still the model result will not change.
This assumption can work for some problems, but it doesn't have to work for all problems.
