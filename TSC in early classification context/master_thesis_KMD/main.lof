\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {3.10}{\ignorespaces TEASER is given a snapshot of an energy consumption time series. After seeing the first s measurements, the first slave classifier $sc_{1}$ performs a prediction which the master classifier $mc_{1}$ rejects due to low class probabilities. After observing the i-th interval which includes a characteristic energy burst, the slave classifier $sc_{i}$ (correctly) predicts RECEIVER, and the master classifier $mc_{i}$ eventually accepts this prediction. When the prediction of RECEIVER has been consistently derived v times, it is output as final prediction \cite {schafer2020teaser}\relax }}{32}{figure.caption.29}%
